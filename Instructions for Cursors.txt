To replace the current Roblox cursors with the old ones, simply open up the Roblox files by right-clicking on the desktop icon, selecting 'Properties' and then 'Open File Location'.

From there, navigate to 'content', then 'textures' and then 'cursors'. Then go to 'KeyboardMouse' and replace the textures in there with the old ones.

Enjoy!
