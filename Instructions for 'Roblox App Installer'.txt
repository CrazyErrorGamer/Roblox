This applet allows you to to close out of Roblox without having to see the annoying Desktop App pop-up. 

It's recommended that you make a shortcut to put in your Start Menu folder. 

If you don't know how to do that, simply look it up. Once you have a shortcut in your Start Menu folder, you can pin it to your taskbar. 

You could also use some sort of keybinder app to make the app run when you press a specific key.

Since the app just does Alt+F4 twice for you, you'll need to open the applet and quickly click back onto Roblox.

Feel free to distribute this anywhere you want.
