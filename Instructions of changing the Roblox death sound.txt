To replace the new death sound back to the iconic 'OOF!', simply open up the Roblox files by right-clicking on the desktop shortcut and clicking 'Properties'. 

Then, click on 'Open File Location'. Navigate to 'content', then 'sounds'. Then, insert the 'uuhhh.mp3' into the folder.

After you have done that, remove the file named 'ouch.ogg'.

Then, rename 'uuhhh.mp3' to 'ouch.ogg'.

Enjoy!
